# Rocket League ALT F4

This script makes it possible to use ALT + F4 to close Rocket League.
I included a compiled version with the original icon. That way you get the correct icon when you pin a shortcut to the taskbar.
You need AutoHotkey to compile it yourself, I included the original icon if you want to use it.

## Instructions

### How to use:

1. Open the .exe OR the .ahk file. It will run in the background.
2. Just press ALT + F4 *While in Rocket League* to close the game.

### How to edit the file/path:

Right-click the .ahk file and click *edit*.
You'll see the following on line 8: Run, *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\RocketLeague.exe*

You can edit the path AFTER *Run,*

Example: *Run, D:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\RocketLeague.exe*
