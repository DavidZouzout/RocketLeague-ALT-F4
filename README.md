# Rocket League ALT F4

This script makes it possible to use ALT + F4 to close Rocket League.
I included a compiled version with the original icon. That way you get the correct icon when you pin a shortcut to the taskbar.
You need AutoHotkey to compile it yourself, I included the original icon if you want to use it.

NOTE: ALT + F4 will still work in other programs while this is running, but it won't work with explorer, so keep that in mind.

## Instructions

### How to use:
1. Create a shortcut to either the .ahk file OR the .exe file. This will also start the game for you, so you can delete your original game shortcut.
2. Open your shortcut to launch the game.
3. Use ALT + F4 *While in Rocket League* to close the game.

### How to edit the file/path:

Right-click the .ahk file and click *edit*.
You'll see the following on line 8: Run, *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\RocketLeague.exe*

You can edit the path AFTER *Run,*

Example: *Run, D:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\RocketLeague.exe*
